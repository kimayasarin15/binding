# Binding T&1 Project 3 MPS CD 25-26
## Overview 

This was my third project for Type and Interaction. This digital binding brings together three texts about design's power to disrupt, navigate, and reveal, exploring how designers shape systems and ideologies. This responsive site was built using HTML and CSS. 

## Readings

The three readings I chose explore the politics and power of design. ‘We’re Meant To Be Bad’ by Tibor Kalman and Karrie Jacobs probes designers to disrupt the norms and embrace creative risks. ’Ten Footnotes to a Manifesto’ by Michael Bierut challenges the split between cultural and commercial design, reminding us that our responsibility is always to the public and that we must navigate this divide thoughtfully. ‘All That is Solid’ by Michael Rock, encourages us to look closer at how design shapes our world to reveal the messages built into it. Across all texts, there is shared understanding that design is never neutral. 

## Design system

Headings and body text are set in Poppins for its legibility and clarity. The visual language relies on basic geometric shapes and a bold color palette to demonstrate the fundamental nature of the pieces which examine designers and design at its core. I wanted to focus on my base paragraph and build up from there with more expressive type moments in the headings. I differentiated each essay by color and used the circle icon throughout. I wanted to replicate the combination of angular lines and round shapes in my typeface throughout my design language. I also wanted the shapes to feel provocative and expressive, without taking away from the base readability. The img I used is a drawing that I made of myself, using similar graphic motifs. 

## Code 

I started with mobile first, and built up from there. I used variables to create a better system in code. I wanted my website to feel ‘webby’ so I used actions like hover and translate so the screen felt more interactive. I also used details/summary to create a dropdown menu. I used both flexboxes and grid to create better visual alignment on the screen for various sizes. For the footer, I put my image in the grid so it could resize with the contents on the left. I struggled a lot with sizing and positioning my svg elements which is something I would like to come back to.
